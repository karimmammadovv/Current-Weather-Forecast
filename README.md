With this program, you can see the current weather forecast of the place where you live. Another function is that you can search for the weather forecast of the place you want.
When the program first opens, it asks for permission for the location. For this I have written codes for location permission in my code. I have used the free API to view the current and weather forecast of the location for the search location. I have used Rxjava and Retrofit for this. Another feature is the lottie animations library for animations.
